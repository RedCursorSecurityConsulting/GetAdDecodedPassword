# GetAdDecodedPassword
This tool queries Active Directory for users with the UnixUserPassword, UserPassword, unicodePwd, or msSFU30Password properties populated. It then decodes those password fields and displays them to the user. It's identical to the function in [Get-AdDecodedPassword.psm1](https://github.com/NetSPI/PowerShell/blob/master/Get-AdDecodedPassword.psm1) but does not require the Active Directory Module be installed.

# GetAdDecodedPassword
This is a .Net Framework 4 execute-assembly compatible rewrite of the [Get-AdDecodedPassword.psm1](https://github.com/NetSPI/PowerShell/blob/master/Get-AdDecodedPassword.psm1) script. This version does NOT require the ActiveDirectory module be installed and should work on any computer. It does need to be exeucted within the context of a domain joined user.
